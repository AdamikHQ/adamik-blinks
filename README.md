# Universal Blink Engine

This project is a multichain "blinks" engine developed during the EthGlobal hackathon in Singapore. It's designed to enhance the multichain experience by leveraging and expanding the "blinks" concept across multiple blockchain ecosystems.

## What are Blinks?

Blinks are blockchain links that allow users to perform on-chain actions—such as payments, voting, or NFT purchases—directly from URLs.

## Project Overview

The Universal Blink Engine aims to:

1. Seamlessly integrate transactions and interactions across multiple blockchain ecosystems within Web 2 platforms.
2. Expand the functionality of "blinks" beyond their initial implementation in the Solana ecosystem.
3. Provide a user-friendly interface for creating and managing blinks for various blockchain actions.

## Key Features

- Multichain support for creating blinks
- Support for donation and staking actions
- Chrome extension for detecting and rendering blinks on web pages
- Integration with the Adamik API for easy multichain transaction crafting
